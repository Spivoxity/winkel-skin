Hooks provided by the Winkel skin.

'WinkelAfterToolbox': Called after rendering the toolbox portlet (#p-tb).
You can use this to inject items (such as ads or a hit counter, for example)
from an extension.
This is the Winkel counterpart to the MonoBookAfterToolbox hook in the MonoBook
skin.

'WinkelBeforeFooter': Called before the footer (#footer) is output, but after
#mw-navigation has been closed.
You can use this to inject items (such as ads or a hit counter, for example)
from an extension.
